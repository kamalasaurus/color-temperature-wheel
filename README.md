## Background

This wheel explores a heuristic about the [line of purples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_purples)

Purple, unlike Violet, is a composite color, composed of red and blue.
In humans, there are 3 cones, red, green, and blue.  Pixel lighting
exploits this fact to generate a full gamut of human perceptory colors.

A common point of confusion is the color wheel.  Electromagnetic
radiation (of which visible light is one manifestation) doesn't actually loop back in on itself.  It actually continues in both directions, to 0ƒ from red and to ∞ƒ from violet.

For example, different species have different lines of purple, i.e. [Bee Purple](http://www.beeculture.com/bees-see-matters/) which is a combination of yellow and ultraviolet light in the human spectrum.

## Rationale

It is of particular interest that purple is perceived as a
bridge of a discontinuity in perception since it is the composite signal of the
low frequency cone (red) and the high frequency cone (blue).  Composites with the mid
frequency cone, green, are percieved as a linear spectrum since they
correspond with a spectral frequency; whereas purple fabricates a
relationship between the highest and the lowest receptors where there is none.  In
that regard, the purple space of perception can be treated as an
anti-color of a spectral analog that spans equivalent extrema of
frequencies:  a parallel rainbow unto itself.

The specific interest of this exploration is in the temperature of
color, which is a qualitative measurement.  A color can only be "warm"
or "cool" relative to another one.  For example, painters have historically noted
that a cold red (crimson) is actually cooler than a warm orange.  In
general, the warmest color is red, and the coolest color is blue.  Since
purple is the composite of both, it stands to reason that shades of
purple can range from the warmest to the cooles extremes relative to
other colors.

- It might be relevant to note that the rods (b & w receptors) are actually
  most sensitive to spectral yellow-green light, and hence wash out
frequencies in that domain.  This is why there are no dark yellows, and
no green stars.  Broad-spectrum green-centered radiation is percieved as
white by the human eye given biased signal amplification since there are
so many more rods than cones.

## Hypothesis

The author believes from many years of observation as an artist, that
there exists an analog in purple for every color on the spectral
rainbow.  As such every temperature relationship on the natural rainbow can
be substituted in whole or in part with a corresponding shade of purple.
